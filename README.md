Used to measure IV characteristics of SNSPDs/Superconducting films (This is what I use it for - you can measure the IV of whatever you wish).</br>
Interfaces with a SRS SIM900 module with a voltage source (SIM928) and voltmeter (SIM970).</br>
Populate the boxes, run the IV and then save (to a .txt) or plot the results.</br>
